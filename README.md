#### This project is my first attempt of creating something with WebGL2.

Your browser must support WebGL2 to use this project. Check if your browser does here: https://caniuse.com/webgl2/.

For a test it will be enough to just download the **index.html**, and **scripts** folder into a single folder. Then just open the index.html and feel free to play with the page.

You can use the **rotation** slider to rotate the figure from 0 to 359 degrees. **y translation** and **x translation** sliders allow you to move the figure from the start of the canvas to its end.
