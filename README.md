#### This project is my first attempt of creating something with WebGL2.

Your browser must support WebGL2 to use this project. Check if your browser does here: https://caniuse.com/webgl2/.

For a test it will be enough to just download the ***index.html***, ***script.js***, ***lib.js*** and ***style.css*** into a single folder. Then just open the index.html and feel free to play with the page.

The page contains a Canvas element, which fills the whole viewport, and of some sliders and checkboxes.
The function each input performs is explained by a label, and if you hover over the input, also by a caption.
